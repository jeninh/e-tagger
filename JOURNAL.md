# TOTAL TIME SPENT AS OF NOW:
## Day 2
## 6 hours spent total
# June 23rd: Started the project!  
Today I started the project. I sorted out what components I will use for the e-Tagger!  
Current BOM:  
e-ink display - Adafruit 2.13â€³ E-Ink Breakout - https://www.adafruit.com/product/4197  
microcontroller - rp2040 https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040-v1-0-p-5026.html?qid=13W4HZ_6op7uopb_1750713346680  
nfc writer thing - Adafruit ST25DV16K I2C RFID EEPROM Breakout - STEMMA QT / Qwiic - adafruit.com/product/4701  
li-po battery - Lithium Ion Polymer Battery - 3.7V 350mAh - https://www.adafruit.com/product/2750  
batery charger module - TP4056 - TC4056A Lithium Battery Charger and Protection Module - https://www.addicore.com/products/tp4056-tc4056a-lithium-battery-charger-and-protection-module   

Tomorrow, I will attend a seminar for the Solder project, so I can actually learn how to use a PCB lol.  

I also want to give credit to Juvenescent Bug and Kashyap S for helping me today in the Slack!  
[will attach images tomorrow]  
**Total time spent: 2h, 21m**

# June 24th: PPP: Parts, PCB, Planning   
(that took me quite a while to make up)  
When asking around in the slack channel, people told me that some of the links I provided (specifically adafruit) are just REALLY REALLY expensive. So, I decided to do some sesearch on the parts.  

Afterwards, I did a tutorial to find out how to use kicad, and spent a little bit on Hackpad! I'm not counting that in this time.     

This BOM attached below is what I devised after researching on the 24th, and the morning of the 25th.
Current BOM (all prices in USD):   
E-Ink Display: Aliexpress[https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005009114917752.html] for $8.66   
Microcotroller: Xiao-RP2040[https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040-v1-0-p-5026.html] for $3.99   
NFC Reader: Unsure as of now, I'm asking around to see if anyone has any good ones that are compatible with the RP2040     
Battery: Also unsure as of now, I'm asking around to see if anyone has any good ones that are compatible with the RP2040    
Charger: Also unsure as of now, I'm asking around to see if anyone has any good ones that are compatible with the RP2040   

Now you may be asking
"Jenin, why are those 3 parts labeled as "unsure" wehn they were written yesterday?"  
Well, to be frank, I didn't know how compatible stuff with microcontrollers work, and after a seminar with Meghana about PCB's now I'm looking for parts that are actually compatible!

(for context, i'm not doing the seminar for the athena award, rather for hackpad and to learn about microcontrollers, which is why i excluded it from my time here)   
**Total time spent: 4h, excluding microcontroller seminar**
